  LauzHack Against COVID-19 is a 72h online hackathon dedicated to fighting the coronavirus crisis.

  Come lend a hand! During the hackathon, you will work on an impactful idea, get help from mentors, and create an open-source prototype.  
  You can come up with your own idea, or work on an existing one.

  To win this fight, we need people with a variety of backgrounds and skill sets.

  With the help of EPFL, we will then support people who want to turn their prototypes into production-quality projects.
